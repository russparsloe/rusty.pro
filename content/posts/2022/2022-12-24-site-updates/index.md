It's been a long time since I updated this site! Almost exactly 4 years in fact. I wasn't totally happy with how the site looked which lead to a bizarre case of not really wanting to update it at all. I've finally had a little downtime to perform some updates and I'm much happier! Here's what I changed... <!--more-->

The most obvious change is that I've updated the theme of this blog to use [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr). I think it's a really clean theme and has support for light and dark modes (toggle them with the button in the top right corner).

I've removed Disqus as I don't really see the need for it. I've also moved away from Mailgun since they removed their free tier, and now use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com) for email redirection.

My next step is to make it as easy as possible to write posts. In order to do so, I plan to write myself a "playbook" of sorts to make it as frictionless as possible and not have to relearn the steps every single time. I'll write a post on it sometime soon!
