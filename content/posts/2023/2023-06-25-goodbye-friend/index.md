I discovered that the [Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) theme I am currently using will no longer be maintained. The repository was archived on 10 June 2023. This leaves me with a decision to make.<!--more-->

I've been using the Hello Friend theme since I had some time to myself during the Christmas break last year to refresh the site. I was impressed with the cleanness of the theme and that it was receiving regular updates. Given Hugo is updated frequently, sometimes with [breaking changes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#changes-in-hugo-01120), it's good if the theme can keep up with it.

Given this change, I have a few options:
* Continue to use the theme as-is and hope nothing breaks
* Fork the code and maintain it myself
* Move to a new theme

For now, option 1 is the most appealing. I don't update the site very often, and so hopefully won't run into issues any time soon. If I do, hopefully they are simple enough such that I can fix them in my own fork.

The idea of finding a new theme doesn't really appeal. It's hard to find something I like and there's always something that's not quite to my taste even with the best of themes.

There is another option - create my own theme. I'd love to learn HTML and (S)CSS and make something that is totally what I want. This is the least likely to happen sadly, but if I get another quiet Christmas, never say never...
