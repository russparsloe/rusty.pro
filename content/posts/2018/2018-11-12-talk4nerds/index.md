I was invited to speak at the R+V Talk4Nerds event in Frankfurt, to give 2 talks - one on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io "HashiCorp Terraform") and the other on [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io "HashiCorp Vault") to an audience of around 100 people. Both talks were recorded and are available on Youtube.<!--more-->

My first talk of the day was on the use of Terraform to provision into multiple clouds, or more generally to deploy and config anything with an API.

I closed up the day with a talk on how Vault allows you to manage secrets and protect sensitive data.

For a moment of humour when disaster strikes, check out the Vault video around the [28 minute mark](https://youtu.be/hT8UGBYq7XU?t=1678 "When live demos go bad").
