I recorded a webinar that explored some of the lesser known features including blocking queries, watches, locks and remote execution.<!--more-->

I prepared a series of bash scripts ([gist](https://gist.github.com/russparsloe/aee8d9ca05a1aceffc963b86928bab1d "Gist containing demo bash scripts")) to help prevent typos under pressure whilst running a live demo.

Funny fact - notice the change in lighting between the presentation and demo, and the Q&A sections. The original webinar ended abruptly before I managed to get all of the questions answered, so I had to come back and re-record them one evening a couple of days later!
